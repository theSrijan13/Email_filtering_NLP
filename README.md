## Overview
This project implements an email filtering system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to automatically categorize emails into different classes such as spam or non-spam based on the content of the emails.

## Features
Tokenization and text preprocessing
TF-IDF vectorization
Naive Bayes classifier for email classification
## Requirements
Python 3.x
Required Python packages are listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-filtering-nlp.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd email-filtering-nlp
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation:

Make sure you have labeled email data for training and testing. The data should be organized into two sets: one for training (train_data.csv) and one for testing (test_data.csv).

## Training:

Train the email filtering model using the following command:

python train_model.py --train_data train_data.csv
This command will preprocess the data, train the NLP model, and save the trained model.

## Testing:

Test the trained model on a new set of emails:
python test_model.py --test_data test_data.csv
This command will load the trained model and predict the labels for the test data.
